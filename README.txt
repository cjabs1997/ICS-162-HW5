Controls:

WASD - Move
E - Interact/Pick-Up
Q - Attack/Chop

Goal:

Pickup the four resources (3 sticks and a piece of coal) and return to the campfire and start a fire (E).
Beware of the evil sheep! And use your axe to clear obstacles. 

Model/Animation Notes:

All models were created by us using a combination of Blender and Maya. All animations were created by us using Unity to manipulate the object's rig. All code was created by us. 
For shaders/particles we used the tools provided to us in Unity. Overall did not use any third party assets.
